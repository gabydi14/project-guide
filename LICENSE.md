## License for Code

Creative Commons is more suitable for documents, images, video,
and other copyrighted work, it is not very suitable for software. For software, 
it is better to use software-specific licenses. For trivial code, we will just use
Creative Commons to cover it (or not use any license). For non-trivial code, especially for software projects, we will choose another license. Different software projects can choose different licenses.
